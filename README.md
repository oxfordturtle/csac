# Computer Science Across the Curriculum

## Applying Computer Science for Fun and Learning, from the Sciences to the Humanities

This booklet is the outcome of a joint venture between _cs4fn_, based at Queen Mary University of London ([www.cs4fn.org](http://www.cs4fn.org/)), and the Turtle project hosted in the Faculties of Philosophy and Computer Science at the University of Oxford ([www.turtle.ox.ac.uk](https://www.turtle.ox.ac.uk/)), with support also from Hertford College, Oxford. The booklet has been co-funded by the UK Department for Education, to whom we are all extremely grateful for being able to provide it free of charge to all UK state secondary schools.

The main aim of this booklet is to provide a bridge from ideas like those explored in the _cs4fn_ magazines -- fascinating applications of Computer Science presented without much complication or technical detail -- to real implementation and practical application of programs that illustrate those ideas. We hope that keen students who found these sorts of things interesting when reading about them will be motivated to explore them much more deeply, through understanding (and later building on) the programs introduced and explained here. The appendix gives lots of references to the _cs4fn_ website, so you can trace connections both ways.

We also hope that teachers across the curriculum will find plenty here that can be used to enliven their lessons and provide ways of helping to explain some interesting phenomena -- from the motion of projectiles and rockets, to evolution and the spread of diseases, to economic and social behaviour -- and also to explore more speculative ideas (such as machine intelligence). Teachers, like students, can gain hugely from learning to understand and write computer programs for themselves, and little prior expertise is expected here.
